# AutoAWP

AutoAWP is a powerful Windows tool designed for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players who want to gain a tactical advantage by automating AWP usage. This application ensures inhuman reaction time by firing the AWP weapon the instant an enemy appears in the scope, making it an excellent utility for holding positions or camping.

## Features

- **Automatic Enemy Detection**: Scans for enemies within the scope and triggers the AWP instantly.
- **Lightning-Fast Reactions**: Fires with unparalleled speed, surpassing human reaction times.
- **In-Game Customization**: Adjust thresholds and debug settings for personalized performance.
- **Safe & Efficient**: Optimized for minimal system impact and stealthy operation.
- **Built-in Sounds**: Audio feedback for charging and firing events.

## How It Works

2. Detects changes in pixels or patterns that match predefined thresholds.
3. Automatically executes a left-click action to fire the AWP when an enemy is detected.
